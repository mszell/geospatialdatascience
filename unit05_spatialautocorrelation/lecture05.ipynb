    "Spatial autocorrelation has to do with the degree to which the similarity in values between observations in a dataset is related to the similarity in locations of such observations. Not completely unlike the traditional correlation between two variables -which informs us about how the values in one variable change as a function of those in the other- and analogous to its time-series counterpart -which relates the value of a variable at a given point in time with those in previous periods-, spatial autocorrelation relates the value of the variable of interest in a given location, with values of the same variable in surrounding locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key idea in this context is that of spatial randomness: a situation in which the location of an observation gives no information whatsoever about its value. In other words, a variable is spatially random if it is distributed following no discernible pattern over space. Spatial autocorrelation can thus be formally defined as the \"absence of spatial randomness\", which gives room for two main classes of autocorrelation, similar to the traditional case: *positive* spatial autocorrelation, when similar values tend to group together in similar locations; and *negative* spatial autocorrelation, in cases where similar values tend to be dispersed and further apart from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we will learn how to explore spatial autocorrelation in a given dataset, interrogating the data about its presence, nature, and strength. To do this, we will use a set of tools collectively known as Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA), specifically designed for this purpose. The range of ESDA methods is very wide and spans from less sophisticated approaches like choropleths and general table querying, to more advanced and robust methodologies that include statistical inference and an explicit recognition of the geographical dimension of the data. The purpose of this session is to dip our toes into the latter group.\n",
    "\n",
    "ESDA techniques are usually divided into two main groups: tools to analyze *global*, and *local* spatial autocorrelation. The former consider the overall trend that the location of values follows, and makes possible statements about the degree of *clustering* in the dataset. *Do values generally follow a particular pattern in their geographical distribution*? *Are similar values closer to other similar values than we would expect from pure chance?* These are some of the questions that tools for global spatial autocorrelation allow to answer. We will practice with global spatial autocorrelation by using Moran's I statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools for *local* spatial autocorrelation instead focus on spatial instability: the departure of parts of a map from the general trend. The idea here is that, even though there is a given trend for the data in terms of the nature and strength of spatial association, some particular areas can diverege quite substantially from the general pattern. Regardless of the overall degree of concentration in the values, we can observe pockets of unusually high (low) values close to other high (low) values, in what we will call hot(cold)spots. Additionally, it is also possible to observe some high (low) values surrounded by low (high) values, and we will name these \"spatial outliers\". The main technique we will review in this session to explore local spatial autocorrelation is the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)."

In other words, Moran's I can tell us values are clustered overall, but it will not inform us about *where* the clusters are. For that purpose, we need to use a *local* measure of spatial autocorrelation. Local measures consider each single observation in a dataset and operate on them, as oposed to on the overall data, as *global* measures do. Because of that, they are not good a summarizing a map, but they allow to obtain further insight.\n",

    "In this session, we will consider [Local Indicators of Spatial Association](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x/abstract) (LISAs), a local counter-part of global measures like Moran's I. At the core of these method is a classification of the observations in a dataset into four groups derived from the Moran Plot: high values surrounded by high values (HH), low values nearby other low values (LL), high values among low values (HL), and viceversa (LH). Each of these groups are typically called \"quadrants\". An illustration of where each of these groups fall into the Moran Plot can be seen below:"

    "So far we have classified each observation in the dataset depending on its value and that of its neighbors. This is only half way into identifying areas of unusual concentration of values. To know whether each of the locations is a *statistically significant* cluster of a given kind, we again need to compare it with what we would expect if the data were allocated in a completely random way. After all, by definition, every observation will be of one kind of another, based on the comparison above. However, what we are interested in is whether the strength with which the values are concentrated is unusually high. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what LISAs are designed to do. As before, a more detailed description of their statistical underpinnings is beyond the scope in this context, but we will try to shed some light into the intuition of how they go about it. The core idea is to identify cases in which the comparison between the value of an observation and the average of its neighbors is either more similar (HH, LL) or dissimilar (HL, LH) than we would expect from pure chance. The mechanism to do this is similar to the one in the global Moran's I, but applied in this case to each observation, resulting then in as many statistics as original observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LISAs are widely used in many fields to identify clusters of values in space. They are a very useful tool that can quickly return areas in which values are concentrated and provide *suggestive* evidence about the processes that might be at work. For that, they have a prime place in the exploratory toolbox. Examples of contexts where LISAs can be useful include: identification of spatial clusters of poverty in regions, detection of ethnic enclaves, delineation of areas of particularly high/low activity of any phenomenon, etc.\n",

Instead, what is typically done is to create a map, a cluster map as it is usually called, that extracts the significant observations (those that are highly unlikely to have come from pure chance) and plots them with a specific color depending on their quadrant category.\n",

Because not every observation represents a statistically significant one, we want to identify those with a p-value small enough that rules out the possibility of obtaining a similar situation from pure chance. Following a similar reasoning as with global Moran's I, we select 5% as the threshold for statistical significance. To identify these values, we create a variable, `significant`, that contains `True` if the p-value of the observation is satisfies the condition, and `False` otherwise.

Comparing the LISA map above with the choropleth we started with, we can interpret the LISA as \"simplification\" of the detailed but perhaps too complicated picture in the choropleth that focuses the reader's attention to the areas that display a particularly high concentration of (dis)similar values, helping the spatial structure of the vote emerge in a more explicit way. The result of this highlights the relevance that the East of England and the Midlands had in voting to Leave, as well as the regions of the map where there was a lot less excitement about Leaving."
